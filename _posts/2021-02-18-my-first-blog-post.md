title: "First Day Exploring Github"
date: 2021-02-18
Today is the first day that I have used Github. I am learning a lot by following the tutorials provided. I am sure that I will continue to learn more as I explore the tutorials provided. My husband is a programmer. I have no experience programming, so this is a whole new world, perhaps even galaxy for me. I am excited to learn more about Github, but most importantly: programming concepts, languages, tools, kand applications.
